# Title

Building a Fullstack NFT Dapp on Flow EVM Testnet from scratch using Solidity and Hardhat for Smart Contracts, EthersJS & ReactJS

This tutorial will guide you through building a fullstack NFT DApp on the Flow EVM testnet. You will learn how to deploy smart contracts using Hardhat, interact with them using Ethers.js, and build a frontend using ReactJS. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a working NFT DApp that allows users to mint and manage their NFTs.

## Objectives

After completing this guide, you'll be able to:

- Deploy and interact with smart contracts on the Flow EVM testnet using Hardhat.
- Use Ethers.js to interact with the blockchain from a ReactJS frontend.
- Build a simple frontend to display and interact with NFTs.
- Implement wallet connectivity and transactions.
- Understand the basics of NFT standards and smart contract development.

## Prerequisites

### Next.js and Modern Frontend Development

This tutorial uses [Next.js]. You don't need to be an expert, but it's helpful to be comfortable with development using a current React framework. You'll be on your own to select and use a package manager, manage Node versions, and other frontend environment tasks. If you don't have your own preference, you can just follow along with us and use [Yarn].
